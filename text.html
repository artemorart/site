	<h2> Life and career</h2>
<h3> 1985–2004: Early life</h3>
 <p> Elizabeth Woolridge Grant was born on June 21, 1985,[8] in Manhattan, New York City,[9] to Robert England Grant Jr., a Grey Group copywriter, and Patricia Ann "Pat" (née Hill), an account executive at Grey Group.[10][11][12] She has a younger sister, Caroline "Chuck" Grant,[13] and a younger brother, Charlie Grant.[14][15] She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent. Her ancestors were from Lanarkshire.[16][17] When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York.[18] In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;[19] her mother worked as a schoolteacher.[20] There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years[15] and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.[15][21]</p>

 <p> She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year,[20] but when she was 14[22] or 15,[23] her parents sent her to Kent School[24] to get sober from alcoholism. Grant shared in an interview: "That's really why I got sent to boarding school aged 14—to get sober."[22] Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend.[25] According to Grant, she had trouble making friends during much of her teenage and early adult years.[26][27] She has said she was preoccupied with death from a young age, and its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation:
When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble. I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time in my life.[28]</p>

 <p> After graduating from Kent School, she spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle and working as a waitress.[19] During this time, Grant's uncle taught her to play guitar and she "realized [that she] could probably write a million songs with those six chords".[29] Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as "Sparkle Jump Rope Queen" and "Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena".[29] "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously", she said. "When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn—I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point—and that was it."[9]</p>

<h3>2005–2010: Career beginnings and early recordings</h3> 
 <p>In fall 2004, at age 19, Grant enrolled at Fordham University in The Bronx where she majored in philosophy, with an emphasis on metaphysics.[9] She has said she chose to study the subject because it "bridged the gap between God and science... I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why."[9] In spring 2005, while still in college, Del Rey registered a seven-track extended play with the United States Copyright Office; the application title was Rock Me Stable with another title, Young Like Me, also listed.[30] A second extended play, From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer.[31] Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded an acoustic album, Sirens, under the May Jailer project,[31] which leaked on the internet in mid-2012.[32]</p>

 <p>At her first public performance in 2006, for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, an A&R representative for 5 Points Records,[33][34] an independent label owned by David Nichtern.[34] In 2007, while a senior at Fordham, she submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks, No Kung Fu, to 5 Points,[31] which offered her a recording contract for $10,000.[31] She used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey,[9][24] and began working with producer David Kahne.[34] Nichtern recalled: "Our plan was to get it all organized and have a record to go and she'd be touring right after she graduated from college. Like a lot of artists, she morphed. When she first came to us, she was playing plunky little acoustic guitar, [had] sort of straight blonde hair, very cute young woman. A little bit dark, but very intelligent. We heard that. But she very quickly kept evolving."[34]</p>

 <p>Del Rey graduated from Fordham with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 2008,[24] after which she released a three-track EP, Kill Kill, as Lizzy Grant, featuring production by Kahne.[35] She explained: "David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop."[36] Meanwhile, Del Rey was doing community outreach work for homeless individuals and drug addicts;[9] she had become interested in community service work in college, when she had helped paint homes on an Indian reservation in Utah.[15][37]</p>



<h3> 2011–2013: Breakthrough with Born to Die and Paradise</h3>
 <p>In 2011, Del Rey uploaded self-made music videos for her songs "Video Games" and "Blue Jeans" to YouTube, featuring vintage footage interspersed with shots of her singing on her webcam.[44] The "Video Games" music video became a viral internet sensation,[1] which led to Del Rey being signed by Stranger Records to release the song as her debut single.[45] She told The Observer: "I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't going to be the single but people have really responded to it."[9] The song earned her a Q award for "Next Big Thing" in October 2011[46] and an Ivor Novello for "Best Contemporary Song" in 2012.[47] In the same month, she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album Born to Die.[48] She started dating Scottish singer Barrie-James O'Neill in the same year. The couple split in 2014 after three years together.[49] Del Rey performed two songs from the album on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012, and received a negative response from various critics and the general public, who deemed the performance uneven and vocally shaky.[50][51] She had earlier defended her spot on the program, saying: "I'm a good musician ... I have been singing for a long time, and I think that [SNL creator] Lorne Michaels knows that ... it's not a fluke decision."</p>

 <p>In September 2012, Del Rey unveiled the F-Type for Jaguar at the Paris Motor Show[60] and later recorded the song "Burning Desire", which appeared in a promotional short film for the vehicle.[61][62] Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar's global brand director, explained the company's choice, saying Del Rey had "a unique blend of authenticity and modernity".[60] In late September 2012, a music video for Del Rey's cover of "Blue Velvet" was released as a promotional single for the H&M 2012 autumn campaign, which Del Rey also modeled for in print advertising.[63][64] On September 25, Del Rey released the single "Ride" in promotion of her upcoming EP, Paradise.[65] She subsequently premiered the music video for "Ride" at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California, on October 10, 2012.[66][67] Some critics panned the video for being allegedly pro-prostitution[67][68] and antifeminist, due to Del Rey's portrayal of a prostitute in a biker gang.[29][69]</p>
 


 <p>Over the next several months, she released videos of two cover songs: one of Leonard Cohen's "Chelsea Hotel#2",[75] followed by a duet with her then-boyfriend, Barrie-James O'Neill, of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra's "Summer Wine".[76] In May 2013, Del Rey released an original song, "Young and Beautiful" for the soundtrack of the 2013 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby.[77] Following the song's release, it peaked at 22 on the Billboard Hot 100.[78] However, shortly after its release to contemporary hit radio, the label prematurely pulled it and decided to send a different song to radio; on July 2, 2013, a Cedric Gervais remix of Del Rey's "Summertime Sadness" was sent to radio; a sleeper hit, the song proved to be a commercial success, surpassing "Young and Beautiful", reaching number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming her first American top ten hit.[79] The remix won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical in 2013,[80] while "Young and Beautiful" was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[71]</p>

<h3> 2014–2016: Ultraviolence, Honeymoon, and film work</h3>

<p> On January 26, 2014, Del Rey released a cover of "Once Upon a Dream" for the 2014 dark fantasy film Maleficent.[86] Following the completion of Paradise, Del Rey began writing and recording her follow-up album, Ultraviolence, featuring production by Dan Auerbach.[87] Ultraviolence was released on June 13, 2014, and debuted at number one in 12 countries, including the United States and United Kingdom. The album, which sold 880,000 copies worldwide in its first week,[88] was preceded by the singles "West Coast", "Shades of Cool",[89] "Ultraviolence",[90] and "Brooklyn Baby".[91] She began dating photographer Francesco Carrozzini after he directed Del Rey's music video for "Ultraviolence"; the two broke up in November 2015 after more than a year.[92] Del Rey described the album as being "more stripped down but still cinematic and dark",[93] while some critics characterized the record as psychedelic[94] and desert rock-influenced, more prominently featuring guitar instrumentation than her previous releases.[95][96] Later that year, Del Rey contributed the songs "Big Eyes" and "I Can Fly" to Tim Burton's 2014 biographical film Big Eyes.[97]</p>

<p>In January 2018, Del Rey announced that she was in a lawsuit with British rock band Radiohead over alleged similarities between their song "Creep" and her song "Get Free".[128] Following her announcement, legal representatives from their label Warner/Chappell denied the lawsuit, as well as Del Rey's claims of the band asking for "100% of the song's royalties".[129] Del Rey announced that summer while performing at Lollapalooza in Brazil the lawsuit was "over".[128]</p>

<p>Throughout 2018, Del Rey appeared as a guest vocalist on several tracks by other musicians, including "Living with Myself" by Jonathan Wilson for Rare Birds (2018),[130] "God Save Our Young Blood" and "Blue Madonna" by Børns for Blue Madonna (2018),[131] and "Woman" by Cat Power for Wanderer (2018).[132] In November 2019, Del Rey was announced as the face of Gucci's Guilty fragrances and subsequently appeared in print and television advertisements with Jared Leto and Courtney Love.[133][134] The campaign was centered around the concept of "Hollyweird".[135] Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele said Guilty is a scent for a woman who does whatever she wants; Del Rey stated she is "very much that person".[135]</p>


<h3>2020–2021: Chemtrails over the Country Club, Blue Banisters, and poetry collections</h3> 
<p>In an interview for L'Officiel's first American edition in early 2018, when asked about her interest in making a film, Del Rey responded she had been approached to write a Broadway musical and had recently begun work on it. When asked how long it would be until completion of the work, she replied, "I may finish in two or three years."[162][163] She also announced she would be contributing to the soundtrack of a new adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[164]</p>

<p>After announcing a spoken word album in 2019, Del Rey released Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass and its corresponding spoken word album in 2020. The physical book was released on September 29 and the Jack Antonoff-produced audiobook on July 28.[165][166] The spoken word poem "LA Who Am I to Love You" was released as the lead single the day before the album's release.

Like Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Chemtrails over the Country Club was mostly produced by Del Rey alongside Jack Antonoff.[175] It was preceded by the singles "Let Me Love You like a Woman" on October 16, 2020,[176] and the title track on January 11, 2021.[177][178] Videos for both songs as well as "White Dress" were also released.[179]</p>

<h2> Artistry</h2>
<h3> Musical style</h3>
<h4> Del Rey has been labeled an "alt-pop"[194]</h4> or alternative pop artist.[195] Her works have been variously categorized as pop,[196] rock,[197] dream pop,[198] baroque pop,[199] indie pop, psychedelic rock,[200] while incorporating trip hop,[201] hip hop,[202] lo-fi,[203] and trap elements.[204] Upon her debut release, Del Rey's music was described as "Hollywood sadcore" by some music critics.[205] It has been repeatedly noted for its cinematic sound and its references to various aspects of pop culture; both critics and Del Rey herself have noted a persistent theme of 1950s and 1960s Americana.[206] The strong elements of American nostalgia brought Idolator to classify her firmly as alternative pop.[207] Del Rey elaborated on her connection to the past in an interview with Artistdirect, saying "I wasn't even born in the '50s but I feel like I was there."[208]</p>

  <figcaption>Artists from Frank Sinatra (left) to Amy Winehouse (right) have influenced Del Rey and her music.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of Born to Die, AllMusic stated that its "sultry, overstated orchestral pop recast her as some sort of vaguely imagined chanteuse for a generation raised on Adderall and the Internet, with heavy doses of Twin Peaks atmosphere".[209] Del Rey's subsequent releases would introduce variant styles, particularly Ultraviolence, which employed a guitar-based sound akin to psychedelic and desert rock.[210] Kenneth Partridge of Billboard noted this shift in style, writing: "She sings about drugs, cars, money, and the bad boys she's always falling for, and while there remains a sepia-toned mid-century flavor to many of these songs, [Del Rey] is no longer fronting like a thugged-out Bette Davis."[211] Upon the release of Honeymoon, one reviewer characterized Del Rey's body of work as being "about music as a time warp, with her languorous croons over molasses-like arrangements meant to make clock hands seem to move so slowly that it feels possible, at times, they might go backwards".[212]</p>

<p>Prior to coming to prominence under the stage name Lana Del Rey, she performed under the names Lizzy Grant, Lana Rey Del Mar,[213] Sparkle Jump Rope Queen,[214] and May Jailer.[215] Under the stage name Lizzy Grant, she referred to her music as "Hawaiian glam metal",[216] while the work of her May Jailer project was acoustic.[217]</p>

<h3> Influences</h3>

<p>Artists from Frank Sinatra (left) to Amy Winehouse (right) have influenced Del Rey and her music.
Del Rey cites a wide array of musical artists as influences, including numerous pop, jazz, and blues performers from the mid-twentieth century, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber,[218] Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Bobby Vinton,[219] The Crystals,[219] and Miles Davis.[220] Torch singers Julie London[221] and Julee Cruise have also served as influences.[219] "[I really] just like the masters of every genre", she told BBC radio presenter Jo Whiley in 2012, specifically naming Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley.[222]</p>

<p>Several rock and pop musicians and groups from the late-twentieth century have also inspired Del Rey, such as Bruce Springsteen,[223] Britney Spears,[224] singer-songwriter Lou Reed, and rock band the Eagles, as well as folk musicians such as Leonard Cohen[219] and Joan Baez. Del Rey has also cited contemporary artists, such as singer-songwriter Cat Power,[223] Hole frontwoman Courtney Love,[225] rapper Eminem, and singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse as artists she looked up to.[219] Del Rey has cited the soundtrack to American Beauty as a partial inspiration for her album Born to Die (2012).[226]</p>

<p>Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting.[227][228] Del Rey has cited film directors, David Lynch and Federico Fellini, and painters, Mark Ryden and Pablo Picasso, as influences[208][229] and has stated actress Lauren Bacall is someone she admires.[230]</p>
